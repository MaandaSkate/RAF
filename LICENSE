6. Google Ads
We use Google Ads on our PHBEE to display advertisements. Google Ads may collect certain information about your browsing behaviour on our PHBEE and other PHBEEs that you visit. This information is used to provide you with more relevant advertisements based on your interests.
Google Ads uses cookies to track your activity on our PHBEE and other PHBEEs that display Google Ads. These cookies do not contain personal information but may contain a unique identifier that is used to track your activity.
We do not have control over how Google Ads collects or uses your information. However, we ensure that all third-party service providers we work with, including Google Ads, comply with the POPIA regulations.
You may opt-out of Google Ads personalization by visiting Google's Ads Settings page or by using the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On. Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertisements, but it will limit the relevance of the ads you see.
7. Past Papers
Please note that the past papers, assessments, etc., all types of PDFs generated by PHBEE are not the actual papers but rather samples or model papers based on information gathered on the internet. The past papers and assessments are for educational purposes only and are not intended to be used for any other purposes, including cheating or academic misconduct. The main focus is to try to help the users improve student performance.
We make every effort to ensure that the PDFs generated by PHBEE are accurate and aligned with CAPS and IEB standards and requirements, but we do not guarantee their accuracy. We are not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from the use of our PDFs.
